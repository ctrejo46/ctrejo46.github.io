						    <p><img src="images/me.jpg.png" width="186" height="186" alt="" class="alignleft border" />I was born and raised in San Antonio, and graduated from Earl Warren High school. My major is Digital Media, and I plan to use that for a job relating to graphic design. Although I planned for graphic design, I’m still a little unsure on how exactly to go about that. I love playing video games in my spare time, and usually hop between different games all of the time. At the time of me writing this bio, I’m currently playing Destiny 2 (One of my favorite games of all time!). My Idol would have to be my dad, and even though he is no longer around, I still look up to him. He had an amazing life, always traveling around the world and exploring with nothing to stop him. He worked hard to get to that point in life, and I truly strive to be like he was. I’m 19 years old, In college, have my first job, and this is just the beginning. Time flies by so quickly, so I’m going to make the most out of my life as best as I can.</p>

							  <p>I am currently in the proccess of learning multiple design programs such as Krita, Photoshop, Blender, Adobe Animate as well as Adobe Premier. I'm a beginner at most of this but I am making a lot of progress. So far I can see myself and my skills skyrocketing into the near future and I'm fully prepared for it.</p>
